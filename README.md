### Security:
This application prioritizes security at every level. It implements robust authentication using session management, with a secret key securely stored in an environment variable. Authorization mechanisms ensure users can only access their own information and debt records, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. To safeguard against SQL injection vulnerabilities, we utilize the mysql2 library, which offers strong protection against such attacks. User passwords are never stored in plain textâ€”only securely hashed passwords are stored, leveraging the BCrypt hashing algorithm. Furthermore, every user transaction is authenticated and authorized to ensure that actions are legitimate and comply with access controls.
